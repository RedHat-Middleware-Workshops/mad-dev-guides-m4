Globex, a fictitious retail company, have completed the modernization of their existing retail e-commerce web application as part of their modernization journey. A schematic overview of the current state of the application as show below:

As a next step Globex would like to expand business with a *multi-channel retailing strategy* through a mobile app and partner channels. This means that the new channels will need access to their core backend API services. 

To secure the access to Globex's core APIs that will be used by the new channels, an API Management platform is needed. To build a wholistic API Management solution, the team decides to adopt an *API First approach* spanning design, governance, mock and management of APIs - which will enable rapid development across teams. 


== Goals of this lab
In this module you will follow this journey:

* *Design* an API resulting in an OpenAPI schema
* Host this OpenAPI schema in a *registry* for use by various teams
* *Mock* the APIs to enable faster inner loop development
* *Manage and secure* APIs to allow access for external teams


== Architecture Overview

Here is a view of the deployment architecture. +

* The Inventory and Catalog services, and the databases are deployed on Red Hat OpenShift. 
* Red Hat API Designer and Red Hat Service Registry, based  on https://www.apicur.io/[Apicurio^], are used to *Design* and *Govern* the APIs
* https://microcks.io/[Microcks^], popular opensource project, is used to *mock* the APIs
* https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/3scale[Red Hat 3scale Management^] is an API Management platform is used to *manage and secure* the APIs. The API gateway is managed by 3scale
